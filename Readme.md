

This repository provides MATLAB code for two different models of gene splicing: exon definition and intron definition. In exon definition, splicing occurs when specific sequences within exons are recognized by the spliceosome. In intron definition, splicing occurs when the spliceosome recognizes the junction between the intron and exon.

The exon_definition_ode.m and intron_definition_ode.m files contain the differential equations for the respective models, while the solv_ode_exondef.m and solv_ode_introndef.m files solve the differential equations for each model.

To run the simulations and generate output, you can use the sampling_model_exondef.m and sampling_model_introndef.m scripts. These scripts provide the solution to the sampling and output Excel tables with different conditions, as well as plots for delta PSI.

If you're interested in learning more about the specifics of gene splicing and the differences between the exon definition and intron definition models, please see the included documentation.
