 The files  exon_definition_ode.m and intron_definition_ode.m are the differential equations wroten in Matlab for exon definition and intron definition cases.

solv_ode_exondef.m and solv_ode_introndef.m solve the differential equations for the exon definition and intron definition.

sampling_model_exondef.m and sampling_model_introndef.m are the scripts to run. They provide the solution to the sampling and give as an output the excel tables with different conditions together with the plots for delta PSI.
